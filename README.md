I’m @frog7072. I am a korean.
I am not an IT engineer, but an amateure programmer. Programming is a kind of my hobby.
I made many database programs for my job with VBA, PHP and MySQL.
Several programs and database I've made along is running for my company. 
Near furture, I have to retire from my company. So, I would like to be a freelancer programmer.
These days, I’m interested in python backend projects. Cause, I've heard python is more powerful tool then PHP.
I hope github helps my dream come true. (Unfortunately, I can't connect github in my office for security.)
Thank you for reading my introduction.
